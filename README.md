## My Process

### Technologies used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first layout
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- lightbox - JS Plugin


### What I learned
This was my first project using JavaScript, and I was very nervous. To my surprise, I found a gallery plugin for myself and understood the documentation to implement the plugin. I loved experimenting with all the different settings or customising.
I loved working with jQuery and found the first couple of lines using the *fadein, fadeout and hide methods* very easy to get the desired effects.
I struggled with the search functionality. I honestly just winged it and went more with instincts and trial and error.🤣

### Continued Development
To replace all jQuery with Vanilla JavaScript.

### Resources
The resource I used for my lightbox plugin was [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/)

## Acknowledgments
I passed this project with **Exceeds Expectations**. I did add a lot of additional styling, and the reviewer was very kind with their final comments. A final comment like the below is what helps build your confidence on this learning journey.
### Reviewer's Final Comment
*Phenomenal job on this first JavaScript project! You have shown a deep understanding of manipulating HTML DOM elements using JavaScript/jQuery, and installing 3rd party libraries and plugins! OUTSTANDING job with all the extra styles, animations, and favicon addition! Keep up the good work and happy coding!*
